# SmartDefender

# About

SmartDefender is a machine-learning–based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed to detect malicious network traffic with high accuracy using an advanced stacked ensemble model. 
This project applies feature engineering, class imbalance handling, and ensemble learning on the UNSW-NB15 dataset to achieve robust intrusion detection performance.

# Key Features
Advanced feature engineering for network traffic

Handles class imbalance using SMOTE

Stacked Ensemble Model:

1. XGBoost
2. LightGBM
3. Random Forest
4. Logistic Regression (Meta-Learner)
Threshold optimization for improved detection

Robust preprocessing and feature selection

Research-oriented, modular codebase

High accuracy suitable for academic evaluation

#  Installation
1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ThakshaRishi/SmartDefender
cd SmartDefender
```
2. Create Virtual Environment
```
python -m venv venv
```
Activate:
```
# Windows

venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux / Mac

source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Training the Model
Run the training pipeline:
```
cd ai_model
python train_model.py
```
The pipeline performs:

1. Data loading
2. Feature engineering
3. Scaling and feature selection
4. SMOTE balancing
5. Ensemble training
6. Threshold optimization
7. Evaluation
8. Model & metric saving
# Evaluation Metrics
The system evaluates the following metrics:

1. Accuracy
2. Precision
3. Recall
4. F1-Score
5. AUC-ROC

Threshold optimization improves classification reliability.

# Sample Output
```
Accuracy   : 94.99%
Precision  : 96.15%
Recall     : 96.00%
F1 Score   : 96.08%
AUC-ROC    : 99.21%
```
Results may vary slightly depending on system and dataset splits.
